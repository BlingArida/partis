# write super detailed simulation section of manual and post to b-t.cr

# implement shared clustering merging in partitiondriver

# add fail/success column to annotation files
# add failed queries to partition output file

# allele finder v vs. j mutation criterion should more explicitly compare rates, i.e. is v rate really higher than j rate?
# allele clusterer is tossing new primary version names when there aren't really indels
# maybe just do another allele removal step after allele clustering?

# AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAaaaaa fix cdr3/junction problem

# need to add some plots for allele clustering
#  - v/j mfreqs for each cluster

# clean up all the complicatedness surrounding choose_new_allele_name(), both when simulating and inferring (why are new snpd+indeld alleles still doing the +yellow hash?)
# fix alcluster length bug (i think the issue is that when vsearch truncates a sequence, we need to un truncate it?) e.g. in /hard/1/
# figure out how I'm missing some alcluster alleles completely
# actually, dammit, the 3/OR16-10 new allele inferred in /hard/1/ alclustering has the wrong name

# datscripts
#  - add sequence to seeds files
#  - switch translation file output to processed-data directory

# wait, doesn't cdr3 length need to be reset if there's an shm indel within cdr3?
# switch to joyplot for partition plots (https://github.com/halhen/viz-pub/blob/master/sports-time-of-day/2_gen_chart.R)
# is functional info correct after fwk insertion trimming and N padding?
# switch everybody over to new utils.align_seqs() fcn

# require output files have .csv suffix (or something)
# write a good error message for when vsearch can't find any v matches (maybe run sw?)

# paper
#  - make sure hmm/ and sw/ germline sets aren't really different
#  - tigger
#    - why is it picking up something *close* to the snpd+indeld genes, but not quite correct?
#  - add time required
#  - data
#   - scheepers
#   - new chaim data (igg + igm) https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bioproject/?term=PRJNA336331
#   - abvitro/kristian data https://peerj.com/articles/2924/?utm_source=TrendMD&utm_campaign=PeerJ_TrendMD_0&utm_medium=TrendMD
#   - simulate with mouse, start from human for inference (and run on mouse data starting from human)
#   - just straight mouse data as well
#  - gls-gen
#    - am i yellowing spurious inferred new alleles?
#  - plots
#    - add nsnps up to at least 6
#    - add multi-nsnps with more simultaneous alleles and more shared snps
#  - light chain allele finding: need to account for larger amount of v to right of cysteine?
#  - mention trainni humanized mice (david meininger, andy mcguire)
#  - maybe use /fh/fast/matsen_e/data/turchaninova2016


# maybe use mds/k-means instead of vsearch for fast clustering

# figure out how to get vsearch to be more permissive with shitty matches to reduce the number of failed queries

# less urgent
#  - split isnp stuff out of color_mutants and combine with hamming_distance
#  - shouldn't the indel-adders be modifying event.codon_positions?
#  - allow indels in both V and J at the same time (?)
# alcluster
#  - need some way to remove template genes when alclustering (or maybe just a way to remove un-assigned genes afterward) [wait i think i did this]
#  - make sure J length is reasonable before using n mutations (i.e., use freq instead of n)
#  - maybe forbid alclusterer to add few-snp alleles
#  - synchronize "gene we just added" and "existing gene" distance/n_snp requirements
# alfinder
#  - move is_a_candidate() stuff into fit_[xxx]()

# optimizations/cleanup (more below)
#  - add a local tmp dir to recombinator
#  - streamline (and minimize -- e.g. remove any of the ones in waterer that you can) add_implicit_info() calls
#    - hamming_distance() is especialy slow
#    - when what you're really doing is checking internal <line> consistency -- maybe just check consistency instead of recaluclating everything
#    - don't recalculate the keys that require that call if they're already in the <line>)
#  - switch all color_mutants() calls to new different-length-handler/aligner
#  - fix /fh/fast/matsen_e/kdavidse/partis_prob/SRR1383455_collapse-unique_atleast-2_partitioning.log
#  - instead of rerunning sw when you add or remove an allele, write something in waterer to switch the v_gene for a <line>
#  - add sstat memory checks to utils.finish_process() (or maybe while you're waiting for them to finish?)
#  - add ape, geiger, and laser to dockerfile r install line
#  - automate n-procs
#    - improve n_precache_proc calculator (expecially for large samples)
#    - auto-set clustering step procs (at least when seed partitioning, since you don't know before you remove other cdr3 lengths how many you'll have)
#    - need to redo n procs in compareutils now that everything's so much faster
#    - get auto-n-procs working in run.py (or partis?) [NOTE look at bottom of compareutils.py for ideas]
#  - improve default n-partitions-to-write (I think just switch back to preserving previous partitions from different n_procs)
#  - check whether translation needs to have a lower fractional bound, i.e. don't let the translation be too much smaller than the actual cluster (c.f. kate-qrs data -- what's happening translation-wise when really big clusters are getting merged)
#  - stop passing ambiguous char to ham both in the yaml and on the command line
#  - could speed up sw a lot by first using vsearch info to use only a few v genes for each sequence

# testing
#  - add allele finding

# ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# fix ham scons test
# fix waterer debug fails-to-rerun so they all print uid (or just one of them? in any case clean it up)
# is best-minus-x stuff still working? (I'm almost certain not -- I'm only calculating the partition log prob the last time through, so all the other times I can't rewind at all. I need to check that this isn't leading to too much over-mergin)
# add only-big-clusters option (well, probably make it the default, and allow to deactivate with --accurate-singletons)
# add kbounds to validation plots (i.e. flag queries for which kbounds didn't include true kset)
# fix fuckup where vsearch partition gets its ccfs
# improve hfrac bounds for vsearch (especially) and regular (maybe use only cdr3 hfrac?)

# definitively fix ig-sw length issue

# data:
#  - katie
#  - cluster these: /fh/fast/matsen_e/processed-data/cft/2016-10-21-rubelt-heritable-influence (/fh/fast/matsen_e/data/rubelt-heritable-influence-2016-10-21/proc_data/B-cell_memory.fasta /fh/fast/matsen_e/data/rubelt-heritable-influence-2016-10-21/proc_data/B-cell_naive.fasta)
#  - kate

# code cleanup
#  - split up utils.py
#  - remove unused stuff from Result (and RecoEvent?)
#  - stop using 'queries', 'duplicates', and 'indels' in sw info (?)

# partition/annotation validation
#  - go through a careful round of partition validation on larger samples (including light chain)
#  - double-check purity/completeness usage (should maybe take account of the fact that we remove duplicate sequences (and simulation should probably just forbid/remove duplicates) UPDATE oh wait but we're not removing duplicates in simulation)
#  - decide what you really want to do for ccf stuff and check_partition()
#  - rerun on all(ish) data sets

# simulation
#  - figure out whether GTR with current parameter setup actually makes sense to use
#  - --simulate-partially-from-scratch throws the out-of-frame exception if you don't use the allele finding testing --initial-germline-dir

# turn per-base mutation rates on
# move dummy d adding in waterer to summarize_query()
# get multi-hmm parameter counting working
# need to do allele removal for d and j

# testing:
#  - needs at least a little light chain action
#  - make sure there's some multiple indels in the testing file
#  - add to metrics:
#    - mutation-freq accuracy
#    - cdr3 hamming or n_mutes
#    - multi-hmm (mebbe annotation accuracy on final clusters?)
#  - add shm indels, maybe directly checking that they're right
#  - re-add numberical precision stuff to test.py diff (diff-paramters.py, was it?)

# allele finding/germline set generation:
#  - for new alleles that are clearly homozygous (i.e. fit is flat and near 1.) we should maybe remove the old allele
#  - I don't think there's a reason in principle, at least for 1 snp, why we can't allow more than one new allele for that isnp
#  - maybe increase self.fraction_of_seqs_to_exclude?
#  - all alleles (including new ones) should have roughly the same mut freq distribution (especially at low mutation)'
#  - try trevor's k-means-style-ish clustering idea
#  - make sure allele finding can't add the same sequence coming from different alleles (update: maybe this is already done?)
#  - do all the plots separately for each potential original snp base (i.e. separate plot for A, C, G, T)?'
#  - add requirement for mulitple j genes for new alleles (?)'
#  - increase n_max_mutations_per_segment for highly-mutated repertoires (?)'

# optimization
#  - could speed up mutefreqer increment if there was only one call to utils get mute freq stuff
#  - could maybe switch to only checking the most likely j frame (maybe by moving backwards through j hmm?)
#  - go through glomerator (and maybe dphandler) and make sure everything that should be a reference or a pointer is one
#  - switch all the c++ map.count() calls to map.find()
#  - figure out a way to call naive_hfracs_.clear() without killing cpu usage
#  - switch only_genes in c++ to a set
#  - may be worthwhile to switch from colon-string hash map scheme to something shorter
#  - kbounds logical or should check if/handle case where one of them is unset (ok not really an optimization, but it's not very important atm)
#  - i think i could switch to running all the ksets of each gene at once (which would drastically reduce the dphandler trellis cache size, since we'd only need to keep one gene at a time), but this would involve a lot of careful rewriting in dphandler
#  - try to incorporate cdr3 length class stuff into loop optimizations in bcrham
#  - can v_match loop in get_padding_parameters() go outside the query loop?
#  - might make more sense to have the real insertions on the right side of v and d (instead of left side of d and j), since then we could easily skip k sets that didn't match the most likely frame (note that this would involve being really careful about all the places in the c++ and python where it assumes they're where they are now)
#  - it might make more sense to ditch the whole k_v k_d parameterization, since since it inherently suggests a rectangular region of k-space, which doesn't take account of the fact that we know beforehand that we shouldn't really be checking everything in that rectangular region
#    - maybe a stopgap would be to increment/decrement k_v/k_d in tandem?
#    - would make more sense to have per-gene kbounds
#  - for partitioning, maybe use time as a proxy rather than number of calculations, perhaps using inter-step vs in-step time (note that at least on my setup the cp commands take a significant amount of time)

# bryan's super-short-read sample
#  - figure out cause of mutation rate discontinuity in some clusters (better insertion mutation rate?)
#    - make a simulation sample with low, even mutation throughout v, d, and j, and see what you infer
#  - print cdr3 mutation rate (and maybe also make plots without dividing by length?)
#  - are mutation rates in J to left of tryp too high? (they're much higher than in the rest of J)
#  - try with no-indels?
