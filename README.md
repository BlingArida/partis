### partis

partis is an HMM-based framework for B- and T-cell receptor sequence annotation, simulation, and clonal family inference.
It is built on top of the [ham](https://github.com/psathyrella/ham) HMM compiler, and uses the [ig-sw](https://github.com/matsengrp/ig-sw) set of Smith-Waterman annotation tools.

The following two papers describe the annotation and clonal family inference functionality of partis, respectively:
